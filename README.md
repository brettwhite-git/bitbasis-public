# BitBasis - Bitcoin Portfolio Tracker

**A privacy-first Bitcoin portfolio tracking and cost basis analysis platform.**

BitBasis helps you track your Bitcoin holdings, calculate accurate cost basis, and manage your transaction history—all while keeping your data private and secure. No exchange API keys required.

## 🌟 What is BitBasis?

BitBasis is a comprehensive Bitcoin portfolio management tool designed for individuals who value privacy and want precise control over their transaction data. Unlike other portfolio trackers that require API access to exchanges, BitBasis uses a simple CSV import system, giving you complete control over your data.

### Key Principles

- **User-Controlled**: You upload your transaction data directly via CSV files or manual entry
- **Secure**: Built on Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) ensuring your data is isolated and protected.
- **Tax-Insights**: Multiple cost basis calculation methods (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO) help you prepare for potential tax obligations

## 📊 Understanding Cost Basis Methods

BitBasis supports three industry-standard cost basis calculation methods. Understanding these will help you choose the best method for your tax situation.

- Most commonly used method for tax reporting
- Often recommended by tax professionals for simplicity
- Best for: Long-term investors with infrequent transactions

### LIFO (Last In, First Out)

- Uses your **newest** Bitcoin holdings first when calculating gains/losses
- May provide tax advantages in certain scenarios (consult a tax professional)
- Useful for traders with frequent buy/sell activity
- Best for: Active traders managing short-term positions

### HIFO (Highest In, First Out)

- Uses your **highest-cost** Bitcoin holdings first when calculating gains/losses
- Can help minimize taxable gains by selling higher-cost basis coins first
- Advanced strategy for tax optimization
- Best for: Sophisticated investors optimizing tax liability

**DISCLAIMER**: BitBasis is not tax prepration or reporting software. Always consult with a qualified tax professional regarding your specific situation and which method is best for you.
